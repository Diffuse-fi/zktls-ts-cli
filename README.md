# Generalized TypeScript Interfaces Library for zkTLS

This is a general case library for building apps and protocols based on zkTLS. The library is inspired by the interfaces developed for the [zk-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reclaimprotocol/zk-fetch) project. The goal of this repository is to create a generalized interface for any zkTLS implementation regardless of the underlying protocol:

* ZK+TEE
* MPC-based

Due to its nature, the library can be used in different projects to provide trustless provable access to different resources.

Visit the [docs page](https://diffusefi.gitbook.io/docs/typescript-cli-for-zktls) for the details on usage.
